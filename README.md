## About the book
Microservices in .NET, Second Edition provides a complete guide to building microservice applications. You’ll start by getting to grips with the unique architectural style of microservices, explained in a way that’s clear and accessible. You’ll move on quickly to practical development skills for building your own microservices using MVC Core and ASP.NET Core, working on real-world projects such as an ecommerce shopping cart. You'll design and build individual services in C# and learn how to compose them into a simple but functional application back end. In brand-new coverage for the second edition, you’ll also learn about scoping microservices and how to handle the complexities of deploying to Kubernetes. Along the way, you'll address production and operations concerns like monitoring, logging, and security.
